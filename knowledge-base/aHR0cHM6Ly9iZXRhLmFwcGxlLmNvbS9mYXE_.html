<ul>
<li><p>WHAT IS THE APPLE BETA SOFTWARE PROGRAM?</p>
<p>The Apple Beta Software Program lets users try out pre-release software. The feedback you provide on quality and usability
helps us identify issues, fix them, and make Apple software even better. Please note that since the beta software has not yet
been commercially released by Apple, it may contain errors or inaccuracies and may not function as well as commercially
released software. Be sure to back up your iPhone or iPad and your Mac using Time Machine before installing beta software.
Since Apple TV, HomePod mini, and HomePod (2nd generation) data and purchases are stored in the cloud, there’s no need to back
up your devices. Install the beta software only on non-production devices that are not business critical. We strongly recommend
installing on a secondary system or device, or on a secondary partition on your Mac.</p>
</li>
<li><p>HOW DO I GET THE BETAS?</p>
<p>As a member of the Apple Beta Software Program, you’ll be able to enroll your iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV, HomePod mini,
HomePod (2nd generation) or Apple Watch to access the latest betas, as well as subsequent updates.</p>
</li>
<li><p>HOW DO I PROVIDE MY FEEDBACK TO APPLE?</p>
<p>The iOS, iPadOS and macOS betas come with the built-in Feedback Assistant app, which can be opened from the Home screen on your
iPhone or iPad or from the Dock on your Mac. The Feedback Assistant app is also available from the help menu of any app by
selecting Send Feedback. If you’re running the tvOS, HomePod software or watchOS beta, you can submit feedback through the
Feedback Assistant app on an enrolled iPhone, iPad or Mac. When you experience an issue or something does not work as expected,
send your feedback directly to Apple with Feedback Assistant.</p>
</li>
<li><p>WHO CAN PARTICIPATE?</p>
<p>The Apple Beta Software Program is open to anyone with a valid Apple Account who accepts the Apple Beta Software Program
Agreement during the sign-up process. If you have an iCloud account, that is an Apple Account and we recommend you use that. If
you do not have an Apple Account, you can create one now.</p>
</li>
<li><p>DO I HAVE TO PAY A FEE TO JOIN THE PROGRAM OR PAY FOR SOFTWARE?</p>
<p>No. Both the program and software are free.</p>
</li>
<li><p>WHAT KIND OF COMPENSATION DO I RECEIVE FOR TESTING?</p>
<p>This program is voluntary, and there is no compensation for your participation.</p>
</li>
<li><p>IS THE BETA SOFTWARE CONFIDENTIAL?</p>
<p>Yes, the beta software is Apple confidential information. Don’t install the beta software on any systems you don’t directly
control or that you share with others. Don’t blog, post screenshots, tweet, or publicly post information about the beta
software, and don’t discuss the beta software with or demonstrate it to others who are not in the Apple Beta Software Program.
If Apple has publicly disclosed technical information about the beta software, it is no longer considered confidential.</p>
<p>Read our Terms for full details</p>
</li>
<li><p>HOW DOES THE APPLE BETA SOFTWARE PROGRAM CONTACT ME?</p>
<p>The Apple Beta Software Program uses the contact information associated with your Apple Account. You may keep your contact
information up to date by visiting account.apple.com.</p>
</li>
<li><p>WHAT’S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS PROGRAM AND THE APPLE DEVELOPER PROGRAM?</p>
<p>The Apple Beta Software Program collects feedback on pre-release software. The Apple Developer Program allows developers to
test and build applications. Participants in the Apple Beta Software Program may receive different beta software from
participants in the Apple Developer Program. If you are a developer, you will benefit from the additional resources available
through the Apple Developer Program.</p>
</li>
<li><p>HOW DO I JOIN AN INVITATION ONLY PROGRAM?</p>
<p>If you are participating in an invitation only program, follow the instructions in your invitation email or login with your
Apple Account to view the invitation.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>HOW DO I GET HELP IF I’M HAVING AN ISSUE WITH BETA SOFTWARE?</p>
<p>Beta software may contain errors or inaccuracies and may not function as well as commercially released software. We encourage
you to submit feedback when you encounter these issues. If you need further assistance, please note that you must restore to
previously-released software prior to contacting AppleCare.</p>
</li>
<li><p>WILL INSTALLING BETA SOFTWARE FROM THE APPLE BETA SOFTWARE PROGRAM VOID MY HARDWARE WARRANTY?</p>
<p>No, installing the beta software does not void your hardware warranty.</p>
</li>
<li><p>HOW DO I STOP RECEIVING BETAS AND INSTALL THE NEXT SHIPPING IOS, IPADOS, MACOS, TVOS, HOMEPOD SOFTWARE OR WATCHOS RELEASE?</p>
<p>When your device is enrolled in the Apple Beta Software Program, you will automatically receive new versions of the beta from
Software Update. At any time, you may unenroll your device so that it no longer receives these updates. Then, when the next
version of commercial software is released, you can install it from Software Update.</p>
<p>Learn more about unenrolling your device</p>
</li>
<li><p>HOW DO I RESTORE A PRIOR SHIPPING RELEASE OF IOS, IPADOS, MACOS, TVOS, HOMEPOD SOFTWARE OR WATCHOS?</p>
<p>Always back up your iPhone, iPad or Mac before installing the beta. Since Apple TV, HomePod mini, and HomePod (2nd generation)
data and purchases are stored in the cloud, there’s no need to back up your devices. To use a previously-released version of
iOS, iPadOS, or macOS, you can restore your device from the backup that you created before installing the beta. Please note
Apple Watch cannot be restored to previously-released OS versions once the beta is installed.</p>

Software Program.</p>
