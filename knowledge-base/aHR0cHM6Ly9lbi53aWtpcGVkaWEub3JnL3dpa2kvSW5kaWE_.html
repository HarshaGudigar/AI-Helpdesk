<p>India, officially the Republic of India,[j][21] is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area; the most
populous country from June 2023 onwards;[22][23] and since its independence in 1947, the world&#39;s most populous
democracy.[24][25][26] Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the
southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west;[k] China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar
to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is near Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime
border with Thailand, Myanmar, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago.[28][29][30] Their long occupation,
predominantly in isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse, second only to Africa in human genetic
diversity.[31] Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving
gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE.[32] By 1200 BCE, an archaic form of Sanskrit, an
Indo-European language, had diffused into India from the northwest.[33][34] Its hymns recorded the dawning of Hinduism in
India.[35] India&#39;s pre-existing Dravidian languages were supplanted in the northern regions.[36] By 400 BCE, caste had emerged
within Hinduism,[37] and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen, proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity.[38] Early political
consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires.[39] Widespread creativity suffused this era,[40] but the
status of women declined,[41] and untouchability became an organized belief.[l][42] In South India, the Middle kingdoms exported
Dravidian language scripts and religious cultures to the kingdoms of Southeast Asia.[43]</p>
<p>In the early mediaeval era, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism became established on India&#39;s southern and western
coasts.[44] Muslim armies from Central Asia intermittently overran India&#39;s northern plains.[45] The resulting Delhi Sultanate drew
northern India into the cosmopolitan networks of mediaeval Islam.[46] In south India, the Vijayanagara Empire created a
long-lasting composite Hindu culture.[47] In the Punjab, Sikhism emerged, rejecting institutionalised religion.[48] The Mughal
Empire, in 1526, ushered in two centuries of relative peace,[49] leaving a legacy of luminous architecture.[m][50] Gradually
expanding rule of the British East India Company turned India into a colonial economy but consolidated its sovereignty.[51]
British Crown rule began in 1858. The rights promised to Indians were granted slowly,[52][53] but technological changes were
introduced, and modern ideas of education and public life took root.[54] A pioneering and influential nationalist movement, noted
for nonviolent resistance, became the major factor in ending British rule.[55][56] In 1947, the British Indian Empire was
partitioned into two independent dominions,[57][58][59][60] a Hindu-majority dominion of India and a Muslim-majority dominion of
Pakistan. A large-scale loss of life and an unprecedented migration accompanied the partition.[61]</p>
<p>India has been a federal republic since 1950, governed through a democratic parliamentary system. It is a pluralistic,
multilingual and multi-ethnic society. India&#39;s population grew from 361 million in 1951 to over 1.4 billion in 2023.[62] During
this time, its nominal per capita income increased from US$64 annually to US$2,601, and its literacy rate from 16.6% to 74%. A
comparatively destitute country in 1951,[63] India has become a fast-growing major economy and hub for information technology
services; it has an expanding middle class.[64] Indian movies and music increasingly influence global culture.[65] India has
reduced its poverty rate, though at the cost of increasing economic inequality.[66] It is a nuclear-weapon state that ranks high
in military expenditure. It has disputes over Kashmir with its neighbours, Pakistan and China, unresolved since the mid-20th
century.[67] Among the socio-economic challenges India faces are gender inequality, child malnutrition,[68] and rising levels of
air pollution.[69] India&#39;s land is megadiverse with four biodiversity hotspots.[70] India&#39;s wildlife, which has traditionally been
viewed with tolerance in its culture,[71] is supported in protected habitats.</p>
<p>ETYMOLOGY</p>
<p>Main article: Names for India</p>
<p>According to the Oxford English Dictionary (2009), the name &quot;India&quot; is derived from the Classical Latin India, a reference to
South Asia and an uncertain region to its east. In turn &quot;India&quot; derived successively from Hellenistic Greek India ( Ἰνδία),
ancient Greek Indos ( Ἰνδός), Old Persian Hindush (an eastern province of the Achaemenid Empire), and ultimately its cognate, the
Sanskrit Sindhu, or &quot;river&quot;, specifically the Indus River and, by implication, its well-settled southern basin.[72][73] The
ancient Greeks referred to the Indians as Indoi, &quot;The people of the Indus&quot;.[74]</p>
<p>The term Bharat (Bhārat; pronounced [ˈbʱaːɾət] ⓘ), mentioned in both Indian epic poetry and the Constitution of India,[75][76] is
used in its variations by many Indian languages. A modern rendering of the historical name Bharatavarsha, which applied originally
to North India,[77][78] Bharat gained increased currency from the mid-19th century as a native name for India.[75][79]</p>
<p>Hindustan ([ɦɪndʊˈstaːn] ⓘ) is a Middle Persian name for India that became popular by the 13th century,[80] and was used widely
since the era of the Mughal Empire. The meaning of Hindustan has varied, referring to a region encompassing the northern Indian
subcontinent (present-day northern India and Pakistan) or to India in its near entirety.[75][79][81]</p>
<p>HISTORY</p>
<p>Main articles: History of India and History of the Republic of India</p>
<p>ANCIENT INDIA</p>
<p>Manuscript illustration, c. 1650, of the Sanskrit epic Ramayana, composed in story-telling fashion c. 400 BCE – c. 300 CE[82]</p>
<p>By 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans, or Homo sapiens, had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa.[28][29][30] The
earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years ago.[28] After 6500 BCE, evidence for domestication
of food crops and animals, construction of permanent structures, and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and
other sites in Balochistan, Pakistan.[83] These gradually developed into the Indus Valley Civilisation,[84][83] the first urban
culture in South Asia,[85] which flourished during 2500–1900 BCE in Pakistan and western India.[86] Centred around cities such as
Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, Dholavira, and Kalibangan, and relying on varied forms of subsistence, the civilisation engaged robustly in
crafts production and wide-ranging trade.[85]</p>
<p>During the period 2000–500 BCE, many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the Chalcolithic cultures to the Iron Age
ones.[87] The Vedas, the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism,[88] were composed during this period,[89] and historians have
analysed these to posit a Vedic culture in the Punjab region and the upper Gangetic Plain.[87] Most historians also consider this
period to have encompassed several waves of Indo-Aryan migration into the subcontinent from the north-west.[88] The caste system,
which created a hierarchy of priests, warriors, and free peasants, but which excluded indigenous peoples by labelling their
occupations impure, arose during this period.[90] On the Deccan Plateau, archaeological evidence from this period suggests the
existence of a chiefdom stage of political organisation.[87] In South India, a progression to sedentary life is indicated by the
large number of megalithic monuments dating from this period,[91] as well as by nearby traces of agriculture, irrigation tanks,
and craft traditions.[91]</p>
<p>Cave 26 of the rock-cut Ajanta Caves</p>
<p>In the late Vedic period, around the 6th century BCE, the small states and chiefdoms of the Ganges Plain and the north-western
regions had consolidated into 16 major oligarchies and monarchies that were known as the mahajanapadas.[92][93] The emerging
urbanisation gave rise to non-Vedic religious movements, two of which became independent religions. Jainism came into prominence
during the life of its exemplar, Mahavira.[94] Buddhism, based on the teachings of Gautama Buddha, attracted followers from all
social classes excepting the middle class; chronicling the life of the Buddha was central to the beginnings of recorded history in
India.[95][96][97] In an age of increasing urban wealth, both religions held up renunciation as an ideal,[98] and both established
long-lasting monastic traditions. Politically, by the 3rd century BCE, the kingdom of Magadha had annexed or reduced other states
to emerge as the Maurya Empire.[99] The empire was once thought to have controlled most of the subcontinent except the far south,
but its core regions are now thought to have been separated by large autonomous areas.[100][101] The Mauryan kings are known as
much for their empire-building and determined management of public life as for Ashoka&#39;s renunciation of militarism and far-flung
advocacy of the Buddhist dhamma.[102][103]</p>
<p>The Sangam literature of the Tamil language reveals that, between 200 BCE and 200 CE, the southern peninsula was ruled by the
Cheras, the Cholas, and the Pandyas, dynasties that traded extensively with the Roman Empire and with West and Southeast
Asia.[104][105] In North India, Hinduism asserted patriarchal control within the family, leading to increased subordination of
women.[106][99] By the 4th and 5th centuries, the Gupta Empire had created a complex system of administration and taxation in the
greater Ganges Plain; this system became a model for later Indian kingdoms.[107][108] Under the Guptas, a renewed Hinduism based
on devotion, rather than the management of ritual, began to assert itself.[109] This renewal was reflected in a flowering of
sculpture and architecture, which found patrons among an urban elite.[108] Classical Sanskrit literature flowered as well, and
Indian science, astronomy, medicine, and mathematics made significant advances.[108]</p>
<p>MEDIEVAL INDIA</p>

<p>The Indian early medieval age, from 600 to 1200 CE, is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural diversity.[110] When Harsha of
Kannauj, who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from 606 to 647 CE, attempted to expand southwards, he was defeated by the
Chalukya ruler of the Deccan.[111] When his successor attempted to expand eastwards, he was defeated by the Pala king of
Bengal.[111] When the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards, they were defeated by the Pallavas from farther south, who in turn
were opposed by the Pandyas and the Cholas from still farther south.[111] No ruler of this period was able to create an empire and
consistently control lands much beyond their core region.[110] During this time, pastoral peoples, whose land had been cleared to
make way for the growing agricultural economy, were accommodated within caste society, as were new non-traditional ruling
classes.[112] The caste system consequently began to show regional differences.[112]</p>
<p>In the 6th and 7th centuries, the first devotional hymns were created in the Tamil language.[113] They were imitated all over
India and led to both the resurgence of Hinduism and the development of all modern languages of the subcontinent.[113] Indian
royalty, big and small, and the temples they patronised drew citizens in great numbers to the capital cities, which became
economic hubs as well.[114] Temple towns of various sizes began to appear everywhere as India underwent another urbanisation.[114]
By the 8th and 9th centuries, the effects were felt in Southeast Asia, as South Indian culture and political systems were exported
to lands that became part of modern-day Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Brunei, Cambodia, Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, and
Indonesia.[115] Indian merchants, scholars, and sometimes armies were involved in this transmission; Southeast Asians took the
initiative as well, with many sojourning in Indian seminaries and translating Buddhist and Hindu texts into their languages.[115]</p>
<p>After the 10th century, Muslim Central Asian nomadic clans, using swift-horse cavalry and raising vast armies united by ethnicity
and religion, repeatedly overran South Asia&#39;s north-western plains, leading eventually to the establishment of the Islamic Delhi
Sultanate in 1206.[116] The sultanate was to control much of North India and to make many forays into South India. Although at
first disruptive for the Indian elites, the sultanate largely left its vast non-Muslim subject population to its own laws and
customs.[117][118] By repeatedly repulsing Mongol raiders in the 13th century, the sultanate saved India from the devastation
visited on West and Central Asia, setting the scene for centuries of migration of fleeing soldiers, learned men, mystics, traders,
artists, and artisans from that region into the subcontinent, thereby creating a syncretic Indo-Islamic culture in the
north.[119][120] The sultanate&#39;s raiding and weakening of the regional kingdoms of South India paved the way for the indigenous
Vijayanagara Empire.[121] Embracing a strong Shaivite tradition and building upon the military technology of the sultanate, the
empire came to control much of peninsular India,[122] and was to influence South Indian society for long afterwards.[121]</p>
<p>EARLY MODERN INDIA</p>
<p>In the early 16th century, northern India, then under mainly Muslim rulers,[123] fell again to the superior mobility and firepower
of a new generation of Central Asian warriors.[124] The resulting Mughal Empire did not stamp out the local societies it came to
rule. Instead, it balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices[125][126] and diverse and inclusive ruling
elites,[127] leading to more systematic, centralised, and uniform rule.[128] Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic identity,
especially under Akbar, the Mughals united their far-flung realms through loyalty, expressed through a Persianised culture, to an
emperor who had near-divine status.[127] The Mughal state&#39;s economic policies, deriving most revenues from agriculture[129] and
mandating that taxes be paid in the well-regulated silver currency,[130] caused peasants and artisans to enter larger
markets.[128] The relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century was a factor in India&#39;s economic
expansion,[128] resulting in greater patronage of painting, literary forms, textiles, and architecture.[131] Newly coherent social
groups in northern and western India, such as the Marathas, the Rajputs, and the Sikhs, gained military and governing ambitions
during Mughal rule, which, through collaboration or adversity, gave them both recognition and military experience.[132] Expanding
commerce during Mughal rule gave rise to new Indian commercial and political elites along the coasts of southern and eastern
India.[132] As the empire disintegrated, many among these elites were able to seek and control their own affairs.[133]</p>

<p>By the early 18th century, with the lines between commercial and political dominance being increasingly blurred, a number of
European trading companies, including the English East India Company, had established coastal outposts.[134][135] The East India
Company&#39;s control of the seas, greater resources, and more advanced military training and technology led it to increasingly assert
its military strength and caused it to become attractive to a portion of the Indian elite; these factors were crucial in allowing
the company to gain control over the Bengal region by 1765 and sideline the other European companies.[136][134][137][138] Its
further access to the riches of Bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army enabled it to annex or subdue
most of India by the 1820s.[139] India was then no longer exporting manufactured goods as it long had, but was instead supplying
the British Empire with raw materials. Many historians consider this to be the onset of India&#39;s colonial period.[134] By this
time, with its economic power severely curtailed by the British parliament and having effectively been made an arm of British
administration, the East India Company began more consciously to enter non-economic arenas, including education, social reform,
and culture.[140]</p>
<p>MODERN INDIA</p>
<p>Main article: History of India (1947–present)</p>
<p>Historians consider India&#39;s modern age to have begun sometime between 1848 and 1885. The appointment in 1848 of Lord Dalhousie as
Governor General of the East India Company set the stage for changes essential to a modern state. These included the consolidation
and demarcation of sovereignty, the surveillance of the population, and the education of citizens. Technological changes—among
them, railways, canals, and the telegraph—were introduced not long after their introduction in Europe.[141][142][143][144]
However, disaffection with the company also grew during this time and set off the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Fed by diverse
resentments and perceptions, including invasive British-style social reforms, harsh land taxes, and summary treatment of some rich
landowners and princes, the rebellion rocked many regions of northern and central India and shook the foundations of Company
rule.[145][146] Although the rebellion was suppressed by 1858, it led to the dissolution of the East India Company and the direct
administration of India by the British government. Proclaiming a unitary state and a gradual but limited British-style
parliamentary system, the new rulers also protected princes and landed gentry as a feudal safeguard against future
unrest.[147][148] In the decades following, public life gradually emerged all over India, leading eventually to the founding of
the Indian National Congress in 1885.[149][150][151][152]</p>
<p>The rush of technology and the commercialisation of agriculture in the second half of the 19th century was marked by economic
setbacks, and many small farmers became dependent on the whims of far-away markets.[153] There was an increase in the number of
large-scale famines,[154] and, despite the risks of infrastructure development borne by Indian taxpayers, little industrial
employment was generated for Indians.[155] There were also salutary effects: commercial cropping, especially in the newly canalled
Punjab, led to increased food production for internal consumption.[156] The railway network provided critical famine relief,[157]
notably reduced the cost of moving goods,[157] and helped nascent Indian-owned industry.[156]</p>

<p>After World War I, in which approximately one million Indians served,[158] a new period began. It was marked by British reforms
but also repressive legislation, by more strident Indian calls for self-rule, and by the beginnings of a nonviolent movement of
non-co-operation, of which Mahatma Gandhi would become the leader and enduring symbol.[159] During the 1930s, slow legislative
reform was enacted by the British; the Indian National Congress won victories in the resulting elections.[160] The next decade was
beset with crises: Indian participation in World War II, the Congress&#39;s final push for non-co-operation, and an upsurge of Muslim
nationalism. All were capped by the advent of independence in 1947, but tempered by the partition of India into two states: India
and Pakistan.[161]</p>
<p>Vital to India&#39;s self-image as an independent nation was its constitution, completed in 1950, which put in place a secular and
democratic republic.[162] Economic liberalisation, which began in the 1980s and the collaboration with Soviet Union for technical
know-how,[163] has created a large urban middle class, transformed India into one of the world&#39;s fastest-growing economies,[164]
and increased its geopolitical clout. Yet, India is also shaped by seemingly unyielding poverty, both rural and urban;[165] by
religious and caste-related violence;[166] by Maoist-inspired Naxalite insurgencies;[167] and by separatism in Jammu and Kashmir
and in Northeast India.[168] It has unresolved territorial disputes with China[169] and with Pakistan.[169] India&#39;s sustained
democratic freedoms are unique among the world&#39;s newer nations; however, in spite of its recent economic successes, freedom from
want for its disadvantaged population remains a goal yet to be achieved.[170]</p>
<p>GEOGRAPHY</p>
<p>Main article: Geography of India</p>
<p>India accounts for the bulk of the Indian subcontinent, lying atop the Indian tectonic plate, a part of the Indo-Australian
Plate.[171] India&#39;s defining geological processes began 75 million years ago when the Indian Plate, then part of the southern
supercontinent Gondwana, began a north-eastward drift caused by seafloor spreading to its south-west, and later, south and
south-east.[171] Simultaneously, the vast Tethyan oceanic crust, to its northeast, began to subduct under the Eurasian Plate.[171]
These dual processes, driven by convection in the Earth&#39;s mantle, both created the Indian Ocean and caused the Indian continental
crust eventually to under-thrust Eurasia and to uplift the Himalayas.[171] Immediately south of the emerging Himalayas, plate
movement created a vast crescent-shaped trough that rapidly filled with river-borne sediment[172] and now constitutes the
Indo-Gangetic Plain.[173] The original Indian plate makes its first appearance above the sediment in the ancient Aravalli range,
which extends from the Delhi Ridge in a southwesterly direction. To the west lies the Thar Desert, the eastern spread of which is
checked by the Aravallis.[174][175][176]</p>
<p>The Tungabhadra, with rocky outcrops, flows into the peninsular Krishna River.[177]

<p>The remaining Indian Plate survives as peninsular India, the oldest and geologically most stable part of India. It extends as far
north as the Satpura and Vindhya ranges in central India. These parallel chains run from the Arabian Sea coast in Gujarat in the
west to the coal-rich Chota Nagpur Plateau in Jharkhand in the east.[178] To the south, the remaining peninsular landmass, the
Deccan Plateau, is flanked on the west and east by coastal ranges known as the Western and Eastern Ghats;[179] the plateau
contains the country&#39;s oldest rock formations, some over one billion years old. Constituted in such fashion, India lies to the
north of the equator between 6° 44′ and 35° 30′ north latitude[n] and 68° 7′ and 97° 25′ east longitude.[180]</p>
<p>India&#39;s coastline measures 7,517 kilometres (4,700 mi) in length; of this distance, 5,423 kilometres (3,400 mi) belong to
peninsular India and 2,094 kilometres (1,300 mi) to the Andaman, Nicobar, and Lakshadweep island chains.[181] According to the
Indian naval hydrographic charts, the mainland coastline consists of the following: 43% sandy beaches; 11% rocky shores, including
cliffs; and 46% mudflats or marshy shores.[181]</p>
<p>Major Himalayan-origin rivers that substantially flow through India include the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, both of which drain
into the Bay of Bengal.[182] Important tributaries of the Ganges include the Yamuna and the Kosi; the latter&#39;s extremely low
gradient, caused by long-term silt deposition, leads to severe floods and course changes.[183][184] Major peninsular rivers, whose
steeper gradients prevent their waters from flooding, include the Godavari, the Mahanadi, the Kaveri, and the Krishna, which also
drain into the Bay of Bengal;[185] and the Narmada and the Tapti, which drain into the Arabian Sea.[186] Coastal features include
the marshy Rann of Kutch of western India and the alluvial Sundarbans delta of eastern India; the latter is shared with
Bangladesh.[187] India has two archipelagos: the Lakshadweep, coral atolls off India&#39;s south-western coast; and the Andaman and
Nicobar Islands, a volcanic chain in the Andaman Sea.[188]</p>
<p>Indian climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, both of which drive the economically and culturally
pivotal summer and winter monsoons.[189] The Himalayas prevent cold Central Asian katabatic winds from blowing in, keeping the
bulk of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes.[190][191] The Thar Desert plays a crucial role in
attracting the moisture-laden south-west summer monsoon winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of India&#39;s
rainfall.[189] Four major climatic groupings predominate in India: tropical wet, tropical dry, subtropical humid, and
montane.[192]</p>
<p>Temperatures in India have risen by 0.7 °C (1.3 °F) between 1901 and 2018.[193] Climate change in India is often thought to be the
cause. The retreat of Himalayan glaciers has adversely affected the flow rate of the major Himalayan rivers, including the Ganges
and the Brahmaputra.[194] According to some current projections, the number and severity of droughts in India will have markedly
increased by the end of the present century.[195]</p>
<p>BIODIVERSITY</p>
<p>Main articles: Forestry in India and Wildlife of India</p>
<p>India is a megadiverse country, a term employed for 17 countries that display high biological diversity and contain many species
exclusively indigenous, or endemic, to them.[196] India is the habitat for 8.6% of all mammals, 13.7% of bird species, 7.9% of
reptile species, 6% of amphibian species, 12.2% of fish species, and 6.0% of all flowering plant species.[197][198] Fully a third
of Indian plant species are endemic.[199] India also contains four of the world&#39;s 34 biodiversity hotspots,[70] or regions that
display significant habitat loss in the presence of high endemism.[o][200]</p>
<p>India&#39;s most dense forests, such as the tropical moist forest of the Andaman Islands, the Western Ghats, and Northeast India,
occupy approximately 3% of its land area.[201][202] Moderately dense forest, whose canopy density is between 40% and 70%, occupies
9.39% of India&#39;s land area.[201][202] It predominates in the temperate coniferous forest of the Himalayas, the moist deciduous sal
forest of eastern India, and the dry deciduous teak forest of central and southern India.[203] India has two natural zones of
thorn forest, one in the Deccan Plateau, immediately east of the Western Ghats, and the other in the western part of the
Indo-Gangetic plain, now turned into rich agricultural land by irrigation, its features no longer visible.[204]</p>
<p>Among the Indian subcontinent&#39;s notable indigenous trees are the astringent Azadirachta indica, or neem, which is widely used in
rural Indian herbal medicine,[205] and the luxuriant Ficus religiosa, or peepul,[206] which is displayed on the ancient seals of
Mohenjo-daro,[207] and under which the Buddha is recorded in the Pali canon to have sought enlightenment.[208]</p>
<p>Many Indian species have descended from those of Gondwana, the southern supercontinent from which India separated more than 100
million years ago.[209] India&#39;s subsequent collision with Eurasia set off a mass exchange of species. However, volcanism and
climatic changes later caused the extinction of many endemic Indian forms.[210] Still later, mammals entered India from Asia
through two zoogeographic passes flanking the Himalayas.[211] This had the effect of lowering endemism among India&#39;s mammals,
which stands at 12.6%, contrasting with 45.8% among reptiles and 55.8% among amphibians.[198] Among endemics are the
vulnerable[212] hooded leaf monkey[213] and the threatened[214] Beddome&#39;s toad[214][215] of the Western Ghats.</p>
<p>India contains 172 IUCN-designated threatened animal species, or 2.9% of endangered forms.[216] These include the endangered
Bengal tiger and the Ganges river dolphin. Critically endangered species include the gharial, a crocodilian; the great Indian
bustard; and the Indian white-rumped vulture, which has become nearly extinct by having ingested the carrion of diclofenac-treated
cattle.[217] Before they were extensively used for agriculture and cleared for human settlement, the thorn forests of Punjab were
mingled at intervals with open grasslands that were grazed by large herds of blackbuck preyed on by the Asiatic cheetah; the
blackbuck, no longer extant in Punjab, is now severely endangered in India, and the cheetah is extinct.[218] The pervasive and
ecologically devastating human encroachment of recent decades has critically endangered Indian wildlife. In response, the system
of national parks and protected areas, first established in 1935, was expanded substantially. In 1972, India enacted the Wildlife
Protection Act[219] and Project Tiger to safeguard crucial wilderness; the Forest Conservation Act was enacted in 1980 and
amendments added in 1988.[220] India hosts more than five hundred wildlife sanctuaries and eighteen biosphere reserves,[221] four
of which are part of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves; seventy-five wetlands are registered under the Ramsar
Convention.[222]</p>

<p>A parliamentary republic with a multi-party system,[225] India has six recognised national parties, including the Indian National
Congress (INC) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and more than 50 regional parties.[226] The Congress is considered center in
Indian political culture,[227] and the BJP right-wing.[228][229][230] For most of the period between 1950—when India first became
a republic—and the late 1980s, the Congress held a majority in the Parliament. Since then, however, it has increasingly shared the
political stage with the BJP,[231] as well as with powerful regional parties which have often forced the creation of multi-party
coalition governments at the center.[232]</p>
<p>In the Republic of India&#39;s first three general elections, in 1951, 1957, and 1962, the Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru-led Congress won
easy victories. On Nehru&#39;s death in 1964, Lal Bahadur Shastri briefly became prime minister; he was succeeded, after his own
unexpected death in 1966, by Nehru&#39;s daughter Indira Gandhi, who went on to lead the Congress to election victories in 1967 and
1971. Following public discontent with the state of emergency she declared in 1975, the Congress was voted out of power in 1977;
the then-new Janata Party, which had opposed the emergency, was voted in. Its government lasted just over two years. There were
two prime ministers during this period; Morarji Desai and Charan Singh. Voted back into power in 1980, the Congress saw a change
in leadership in 1984, when Indira Gandhi was assassinated; she was succeeded by her son Rajiv Gandhi, who won an easy victory in
the general elections later that year. The Congress was voted out again in 1989 when a National Front coalition, led by the newly
formed Janata Dal in alliance with the Left Front, won the elections; that government too proved relatively short-lived, lasting
just under two years. There were two prime ministers during this period; V.P. Singh and Chandra Shekhar.[233] Elections were held
again in 1991; no party won an absolute majority. The Congress, as the largest single party, was able to form a minority
government led by P. V. Narasimha Rao.[234]</p>

<p>A two-year period of political turmoil followed the general election of 1996. Several short-lived alliances shared power at the
centre. The BJP formed a government briefly in 1996; it was followed by two comparatively long-lasting United Front coalitions,
which depended on external support. There were two prime ministers during this period; H.D. Deve Gowda and I.K. Gujral. In 1998,
the BJP was able to form a successful coalition, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). Led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the NDA
became the first non-Congress, coalition government to complete a five-year term.[235] Again in the 2004 Indian general elections,
no party won an absolute majority, but the Congress emerged as the largest single party, forming another successful coalition: the
United Progressive Alliance (UPA). It had the support of left-leaning parties and MPs who opposed the BJP. The UPA returned to
power in the 2009 general election with increased numbers, and it no longer required external support from India&#39;s communist
parties.[236] That year, Manmohan Singh became the first prime minister since Jawaharlal Nehru in 1957 and 1962 to be re-elected
to a consecutive five-year term.[237] In the 2014 general election, the BJP became the first political party since 1984 to win a
majority and govern without the support of other parties.[238] In the 2019 general election, the BJP was victorious again with
majority. In the 2024 general election, the BJP failed to achieve majority and the BJP-led NDA coalition formed the government.

<p>GOVERNMENT</p>
<p>Main articles: Government of India and Constitution of India
Rashtrapati Bhavan, the official residence of the President of India, was designed by British architects Edwin Lutyens and Herbert
Baker for the Viceroy of India, and constructed between 1911 and 1931 during the British Raj.[240]</p>
<p>India is a federation with a parliamentary system governed under the Constitution of India—the country&#39;s supreme legal document.
It is a constitutional republic. Federalism in India defines the power distribution between the union and the states. The
Constitution of India, which came into effect on 26 January 1950,[241] originally stated India to be a &quot;democratic republic;&quot; this
characterisation was amended in 1971 to a &quot;socialist, secular, democratic republic&quot;.[242] India&#39;s form of government,
traditionally described as &quot;quasi-federal&quot; with a strong centre and weak states,[243] has grown increasingly federal since the
late 1990s as a result of political, economic, and social changes.[244][245]</p>
<p>The Government of India comprises three branches: the Executive, Legislature, and Judiciary.[246] The President of India is the
ceremonial head of state,[247] who is elected indirectly for a five-year term by an electoral college comprising members of
national and state legislatures.[248][249] The Prime Minister of India is the head of government and exercises most executive
power.[250] Appointed by the president,[251] the prime minister is by convention supported by the party or political alliance
having a majority of seats in the lower house of parliament.[250] The executive of the Indian government consists of the
president, the vice-president, and the Union Council of Ministers—with the cabinet being its executive committee—headed by the
prime minister. Any minister holding a portfolio must be a member of one of the houses of parliament.[247] In the Indian
parliamentary system, the executive is subordinate to the legislature; the prime minister and their council are directly
responsible to the lower house of the parliament. Civil servants act as permanent executives and all decisions of the executive
are implemented by them.[252]</p>
<p>The legislature of India is the bicameral parliament. Operating under a Westminster-style parliamentary system, it comprises an
upper house called the Rajya Sabha (Council of States) and a lower house called the Lok Sabha (House of the People).[253] The
Rajya Sabha is a permanent body of 245 members who serve staggered six-year terms with elections every 2 years.[254] Most are
elected indirectly by the state and union territorial legislatures in numbers proportional to their state&#39;s share of the national
population.[251] The Lok Sabha&#39;s 543 members are elected directly by popular vote among citizens aged at least 18;[255] they
represent single-member constituencies for five-year terms.[256] The Indian constitution historically allowed for the nomination
of Anglo-Indians to two seats in the Lok Sabha; this provision was removed in 2019.[255][257] A number of seats from each state
are reserved for candidates from Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in proportion to their population within that state.[255]</p>
<p>India has a three-tier unitary independent judiciary[258] comprising the supreme court, headed by the Chief Justice of India,
25 high courts, and a large number of trial courts.[258] The supreme court has original jurisdiction over cases involving
fundamental rights and over disputes between states and the centre and has appellate jurisdiction over the high courts.[259] It
has the power to both strike down union or state laws which contravene the constitution[260] and invalidate any government action
it deems unconstitutional.[261]</p>
<p>ADMINISTRATIVE DIVISIONS</p>

<p>India is a federal union comprising 28 states and 8 union territories.[12] All states, as well as the union territories of Jammu
and Kashmir, Puducherry and the National Capital Territory of Delhi, have elected legislatures and governments following the
Westminster system. The remaining five union territories are directly ruled by the central government through appointed
administrators. In 1956, under the States Reorganisation Act, states were reorganised on a linguistic basis.[262] There are over a
quarter of a million local government bodies at city, town, block, district and village levels.[263]</p>

<p>FOREIGN, ECONOMIC, AND STRATEGIC RELATIONS</p>
<p>Main articles: Foreign relations of India and Indian Armed Forces
During the 1950s and 60s, India played a pivotal role in the Non-Aligned Movement.[264] From left to right: Gamal Abdel Nasser of
United Arab Republic (now Egypt), Josip Broz Tito of Yugoslavia and Jawaharlal Nehru in Belgrade, September 1961.</p>
<p>In the 1950s, India strongly supported decolonisation in Africa and Asia and played a leading role in the Non-Aligned
Movement.[265] After initially cordial relations with neighbouring China, India went to war with China in 1962 and was widely
thought to have been humiliated.[266] This was followed by another military conflict in 1967 in which India successfully repelled
Chinese attack.[267] India has had tense relations with neighbouring Pakistan. The two have gone to war four times: in 1947, 1965,
1971, and 1999. Three of these wars were fought over the disputed territory of Kashmir, while the third, the 1971 war, followed
from India&#39;s support for the independence of Bangladesh.[268] In the late 1980s, the Indian military twice intervened abroad at
the invitation of the host country: a peace-keeping operation in Sri Lanka between 1987 and 1990; and an armed intervention to
prevent a 1988 coup d&#39;état attempt in the Maldives. After the 1965 war with Pakistan, India began to pursue close military and
economic ties with the Soviet Union; by the late 1960s, the Soviet Union was its largest arms supplier.[269]</p>
<p>Aside from its ongoing special relationship with Russia,[270] India has wide-ranging defence relations with Israel and France. In
recent years, it has played key roles in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation and the World Trade Organization.
The nation has provided 100,000 military and police personnel to serve in 35 UN peacekeeping operations across four continents. It
participates in the East Asia Summit, the G8+5, and other multilateral forums.[271] India has close economic ties with countries
in South America,[272] Asia, and Africa; it pursues a &quot;Look East&quot; policy that seeks to strengthen partnerships with the ASEAN
nations, Japan, and South Korea that revolve around many issues, but especially those involving economic investment and regional
security.[273][274]</p>

<p>China&#39;s nuclear test of 1964, as well as its repeated threats to intervene in support of Pakistan in the 1965 war, convinced India
to develop nuclear weapons.[276] India conducted its first nuclear weapons test in 1974 and carried out additional underground
testing in 1998. Despite criticism and military sanctions, India has signed neither the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty nor
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, considering both to be flawed and discriminatory.[277] India maintains a &quot;no first use&quot;
nuclear policy and is developing a nuclear triad capability as a part of its &quot;Minimum Credible Deterrence&quot; doctrine.[278][279] It
is developing a ballistic missile defence shield and, a fifth-generation fighter jet.[280][281] Other indigenous military projects
involve the design and implementation of Vikrant-class aircraft carriers and Arihant-class nuclear submarines.[282]</p>
<p>India is estimated to possess up to 172 nuclear warheads, and is considered to be producing both highly enriched uranium (HEU) and
weapons-grade plutonium, with its HEU production assumed to be focused on its growing number of nuclear-powered vessels&#39; and
submarines&#39; fuels.[283][284] Kristensen et al. of Nuclear Information Project with the Federation of American Scientists estimate
that India is operating eight nuclear-capable systems as of 2024, including aircraft, land-based and sea-based ballistic missile
systems, with most of its programs in development thought to be nearing &quot;completion and to be fielded with the armed forces
soon&quot;.[283]</p>
<p>Since the end of the Cold War, India has increased its economic, strategic, and military co-operation with the United States and
the European Union.[285] In 2008, a civilian nuclear agreement was signed between India and the United States. Although India
possessed nuclear weapons at the time and was not a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, it received waivers from the
International Atomic Energy Agency and the Nuclear Suppliers Group, ending earlier restrictions on India&#39;s nuclear technology and
commerce. As a consequence, India became the sixth de facto nuclear weapons state.[286] India subsequently signed co-operation
agreements involving civilian nuclear energy with Russia,[287] France,[288] the United Kingdom,[289] and Canada.[290]</p>

world&#39;s second-largest military. It comprises the Indian Army, the Indian Navy, the Indian Air Force, and the Indian Coast
Guard.[291] The official Indian defence budget for 2011 was US$36.03 billion, or 1.83% of GDP.[292] Defence expenditure was pegged
at US$70.12 billion for fiscal year 2022–23 and, increased 9.8% than previous fiscal year.[293][294] India is the world&#39;s
second-largest arms importer; between 2016 and 2020, it accounted for 9.5% of the total global arms imports.[295] Much of the
military expenditure was focused on defence against Pakistan and countering growing Chinese influence in the Indian Ocean.[296] In
May 2017, the Indian Space Research Organisation launched the South Asia Satellite, a gift from India to its neighbouring SAARC
countries.[297] In October 2018, India signed a US$5.43 billion (over ₹400 billion) agreement with Russia to procure four S-400
Triumf surface-to-air missile defence systems, Russia&#39;s most advanced long-range missile defence system.[298]</p>

<p>According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Indian economy in 2024 was nominally worth $3.94 trillion; it was the
fifth-largest economy by market exchange rates and is, at around $15.0 trillion, the third-largest by purchasing power parity
(PPP).[17] With its average annual GDP growth rate of 5.8% over the past two decades, and reaching 6.1% during 2011–2012,[302]
India is one of the world&#39;s fastest-growing economies.[303] However, due to its low GDP per capita—which ranks 136th in the world
in nominal per capita income and 125th in per capita income adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP)—the vast majority of
Indians fall into the low-income group.[304][305] Until 1991, all Indian governments followed protectionist policies that were
influenced by socialist economics. Widespread state intervention and regulation largely walled the economy off from the outside
world. An acute balance of payments crisis in 1991 forced the nation to liberalise its economy;[306] since then, it has moved
increasingly towards a free-market system[307][308] by emphasising both foreign trade and direct investment inflows.[309] India
has been a member of World Trade Organization since 1 January 1995.[310]</p>
<p>The 522-million-worker Indian labour force is the world&#39;s second largest, as of 2017[update].[291] The service sector makes up
55.6% of GDP, the industrial sector 26.3% and the agricultural sector 18.1%. India&#39;s foreign exchange remittances of US$100
billion in 2022,[311] highest in the world, were contributed to its economy by 32 million Indians working in foreign
countries.[312] Major agricultural products include rice, wheat, oilseed, cotton, jute, tea, sugarcane, and potatoes.[12] Major
industries include textiles, telecommunications, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, food processing, steel, transport
equipment, cement, mining, petroleum, machinery, and software.[12] In 2006, the share of external trade in India&#39;s GDP stood at
24%, up from 6% in 1985.[307] In 2008, India&#39;s share of world trade was 1.7%;[313] In 2021, India was the world&#39;s ninth-largest
importer and the sixteenth-largest exporter.[314] Major exports include petroleum products, textile goods, jewellery, software,
engineering goods, chemicals, and manufactured leather goods.[12] Major imports include crude oil, machinery, gems, fertiliser,
and chemicals.[12] Between 2001 and 2011, the contribution of petrochemical and engineering goods to total exports grew from 14%
to 42%.[315] India was the world&#39;s second-largest textile exporter after China in the 2013 calendar year.[316]</p>
<p>Averaging an economic growth rate of 7.5% for several years prior to 2007,[307] India has more than doubled its hourly wage rates
during the first decade of the 21st century.[317] Some 431 million Indians have left poverty since 1985; India&#39;s middle classes
are projected to number around 580 million by 2030.[318] Though ranking 68th in global competitiveness,[319] as of 2010[update],
India ranks 17th in financial market sophistication, 24th in the banking sector, 44th in business sophistication, and 39th in
innovation, ahead of several advanced economies.[320] With seven of the world&#39;s top 15 information technology outsourcing
companies based in India, as of 2009[update], the country is viewed as the second-most favourable outsourcing destination after
the United States.[321] India is ranked 39th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024.[322] In 2023, India&#39;s consumer market was the
world&#39;s fifth largest.[323]</p>
<p>Driven by growth, India&#39;s nominal GDP per capita increased steadily from US$308 in 1991, when economic liberalisation began, to
US$1,380 in 2010, to an estimated US$2,731 in 2024. It is expected to grow to US$3,264 by 2026.[17] However, it has remained lower
than those of other Asian developing countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Thailand, and is expected
to remain so in the near future.</p>
<p>A panorama of Bengaluru, the centre of India&#39;s software development economy. In the 1980s, when the first multinational
corporations began to set up centres in India, they chose Bengaluru (then called Bangalore) because of the large pool of skilled

<p>According to a 2011 PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) report, India&#39;s GDP at purchasing power parity could overtake that of the United
States by 2045.[325] During the next four decades, Indian GDP is expected to grow at an annualised average of 8%, making it
potentially the world&#39;s fastest-growing major economy until 2050.[325] The report highlights key growth factors: a young and
rapidly growing working-age population; growth in the manufacturing sector because of rising education and engineering skill
levels; and sustained growth of the consumer market driven by a rapidly growing middle-class.[325] The World Bank cautions that,
for India to achieve its economic potential, it must continue to focus on public sector reform, transport infrastructure,
agricultural and rural development, removal of labour regulations, education, energy security, and public health and
nutrition.[326]</p>

close to US$100 billion equalling 7.5% of Indian GDP, and contributed 26% of India&#39;s merchandise exports.[333]</p>
<p>The pharmaceutical industry in India emerged as a global player. As of 2021, with 3000 pharmaceutical companies and 10,500
manufacturing units, India is the world&#39;s third-largest pharmaceutical producer, largest producer of generic medicines and supply
up to 50–60% of global vaccines demand, these all contribute up to US$24.44 billions in exports and India&#39;s local pharmaceutical
market is estimated up to US$42 billion.[334][335] India is among the top 12 biotech destinations in the world.[336][337] The
Indian biotech industry grew by 15.1% in 2012–2013, increasing its revenues from ₹204.4 billion (Indian rupees) to ₹235.24 billion
(US$3.94 billion at June 2013 exchange rates).[338]</p>
<p>ENERGY</p>

<p>India&#39;s capacity to generate electrical power is 300 gigawatts, of which 42 gigawatts is renewable.[339] The country&#39;s usage of
coal is a major cause of greenhouse gas emissions by India but its renewable energy is competing strongly.[340] India emits about
7% of global greenhouse gas emissions. This equates to about 2.5 tons of carbon dioxide per person per year, which is half the
world average.[341][342] Increasing access to electricity and clean cooking with liquefied petroleum gas have been priorities for
energy in India.[343]</p>

<p>Despite economic growth during recent decades, India continues to face socio-economic challenges. In 2006, India contained the
largest number of people living below the World Bank&#39;s international poverty line of US$1.25 per day.[345] The proportion
decreased from 60% in 1981 to 42% in 2005.[346] Under the World Bank&#39;s later revised poverty line, it was 21% in 2011.[q][348]
30.7% of India&#39;s children under the age of five are underweight.[349] According to a Food and Agriculture Organization report in
2015, 15% of the population is undernourished.[350][351] The Midday Meal Scheme attempts to lower these rates.[352]</p>
<p>A 2018 Walk Free Foundation report estimated that nearly 8 million people in India were living in different forms of modern
slavery, such as bonded labour, child labour, human trafficking, and forced begging.[353] According to the 2011 census, there were
10.1 million child labourers in the country, a decline of 2.6 million from 12.6 million in 2001.[354]</p>
<p>Since 1991, economic inequality between India&#39;s states has consistently grown: the per-capita net state domestic product of the
richest states in 2007 was 3.2 times that of the poorest.[355] Corruption in India is perceived to have decreased. According to
the Corruption Perceptions Index, India ranked 78th out of 180 countries in 2018, an improvement from 85th in 2014.[356][357]</p>

<p>With an estimated 1,428,627,663 residents in 2023, India is the world&#39;s most populous country.[13] 1,210,193,422 residents were
reported in the 2011 provisional census report.[358] Its population grew by 17.64% from 2001 to 2011,[359] compared to 21.54%
growth in the previous decade (1991–2001).[359] The human sex ratio, according to the 2011 census, is 940 females per 1,000
males.[358] The median age was 28.7 in 2020.[291] The first post-colonial census, conducted in 1951, counted 361 million
people.[360] Medical advances made in the last 50 years as well as increased agricultural productivity brought about by the &quot;Green
Revolution&quot; have caused India&#39;s population to grow rapidly.[361]</p>
<p>The life expectancy in India is at 70 years—71.5 years for women, 68.7 years for men.[291] There are around 93 physicians per
100,000 people.[362] Migration from rural to urban areas has been an important dynamic in India&#39;s recent history. The number of
people living in urban areas grew by 31.2% between 1991 and 2001.[363] Yet, in 2001, over 70% still lived in rural
areas.[364][365] The level of urbanisation increased further from 27.81% in the 2001 Census to 31.16% in the 2011 Census. The
slowing down of the overall population growth rate was due to the sharp decline in the growth rate in rural areas since 1991.[366]
According to the 2011 census, there are 53 million-plus urban agglomerations in India; among them Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai,
Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad, in decreasing order by population.[367] The literacy rate in 2011 was 74.04%: 65.46% among
females and 82.14% among males.[368] The rural-urban literacy gap, which was 21.2 percentage points in 2001, dropped to 16.1
percentage points in 2011. The improvement in the rural literacy rate is twice that of urban areas.[366] Kerala is the most
literate state with 93.91% literacy; while Bihar the least with 63.82%.[368]</p>

<p>Among speakers of the Indian languages, 74% speak Indo-Aryan languages, the easternmost branch of the Indo-European languages; 24%
speak Dravidian languages, indigenous to South Asia and spoken widely before the spread of Indo-Aryan languages and 2% speak
Austroasiatic languages or the Sino-Tibetan languages. India has no national language.[369] Hindi, with the largest number of
speakers, is the official language of the government.[370][371] English is used extensively in business and administration and has
the status of a &quot;subsidiary official language&quot;;[6] it is important in education, especially as a medium of higher education. Each
state and union territory has one or more official languages, and the constitution recognises in particular 22 &quot;scheduled
languages&quot;.</p>
<p>The 2011 census reported the religion in India with the largest number of followers was Hinduism (79.80% of the population),
followed by Islam (14.23%); the remaining were Christianity (2.30%), Sikhism (1.72%), Buddhism (0.70%), Jainism (0.36%) and
others[r] (0.9%).[11] India has the third-largest Muslim population—the largest for a non-Muslim majority country.[372][373]</p>
<p>CULTURE</p>
<p>Main article: Culture of India
A Sikh pilgrim at the Harmandir Sahib, or Golden Temple, in Amritsar, Punjab</p>
<p>Indian cultural history spans more than 4,500 years.[374] During the Vedic period (c. 1700 BCE – c. 500 BCE), the foundations of
Hindu philosophy, mythology, theology and literature were laid, and many beliefs and practices which still exist today, such as
dhárma, kárma, yóga, and mokṣa, were established.[74] India is notable for its religious diversity, with Hinduism, Buddhism,
Sikhism, Islam, Christianity, and Jainism among the nation&#39;s major religions.[375] The predominant religion, Hinduism, has been
shaped by various historical schools of thought, including those of the Upanishads,[376] the Yoga Sutras, the Bhakti
movement,[375] and by Buddhist philosophy.[377]</p>
<p>VISUAL ART</p>
<p>Main article: Indian art</p>
<p>India has a very ancient tradition of art, which has exchanged many influences with the rest of Eurasia, especially in the first
millennium, when Buddhist art spread with Indian religions to Central, East and Southeast Asia, the last also greatly influenced
by Hindu art.[378] Thousands of seals from the Indus Valley Civilization of the third millennium BCE have been found, usually
carved with animals, but a few with human figures. The &quot;Pashupati&quot; seal, excavated in Mohenjo-daro, Pakistan, in 1928–29, is the
best known.[379][380] After this there is a long period with virtually nothing surviving.[380][381] Almost all surviving ancient
Indian art thereafter is in various forms of religious sculpture in durable materials, or coins. There was probably originally far
more in wood, which is lost. In north India Mauryan art is the first imperial movement.[382][383][384] In the first millennium CE,
Buddhist art spread with Indian religions to Central, East and Southeast Asia, the last also greatly influenced by Hindu art.[385]
Over the following centuries a distinctly Indian style of sculpting the human figure developed, with less interest in articulating
precise anatomy than ancient Greek sculpture but showing smoothly flowing forms expressing prana (&quot;breath&quot; or
life-force).[386][387] This is often complicated by the need to give figures multiple arms or heads, or represent different
genders on the left and right of figures, as with the Ardhanarishvara form of Shiva and Parvati.[388][389]</p>
<p>Most of the earliest large sculpture is Buddhist, either excavated from Buddhist stupas such as Sanchi, Sarnath and
Amaravati,[390] or is rock cut reliefs at sites such as Ajanta, Karla and Ellora. Hindu and Jain sites appear rather
later.[391][392] In spite of this complex mixture of religious traditions, generally, the prevailing artistic style at any time
and place has been shared by the major religious groups, and sculptors probably usually served all communities.[393] Gupta art, at
its peak c. 300 CE – c. 500 CE, is often regarded as a classical period whose influence lingered for many centuries after; it saw
a new dominance of Hindu sculpture, as at the Elephanta Caves.[394][395] Across the north, this became rather stiff and formulaic
after c. 800 CE, though rich with finely carved detail in the surrounds of statues.[396] But in the South, under the Pallava and
Chola dynasties, sculpture in both stone and bronze had a sustained period of great achievement; the large bronzes with Shiva as
Nataraja have become an iconic symbol of India.[397][398]</p>
<p>Ancient painting has only survived at a few sites, of which the crowded scenes of court life in the Ajanta Caves are by far the
most important, but it was evidently highly developed, and is mentioned as a courtly accomplishment in Gupta times.[399][400]
Painted manuscripts of religious texts survive from Eastern India about the 10th century onwards, most of the earliest being
Buddhist and later Jain. No doubt the style of these was used in larger paintings.[401] The Persian-derived Deccan painting,
starting just before the Mughal miniature, between them give the first large body of secular painting, with an emphasis on
portraits, and the recording of princely pleasures and wars.[402][403] The style spread to Hindu courts, especially among the
Rajputs, and developed a variety of styles, with the smaller courts often the most innovative, with figures such as Nihâl Chand
and Nainsukh.[404][405] As a market developed among European residents, it was supplied by Company painting by Indian artists with
considerable Western influence.[406][407] In the 19th century, cheap Kalighat paintings of gods and everyday life, done on paper,
were urban folk art from Calcutta, which later saw the Bengal School of Art, reflecting the art colleges founded by the British,
the first movement in modern Indian painting.[408][409]</p>

<p>Much of Indian architecture, including the Taj Mahal, other works of Indo-Islamic Mughal architecture, and South Indian
architecture, blends ancient local traditions with imported styles.[410] Vernacular architecture is also regional in its flavours.
Vastu shastra, literally &quot;science of construction&quot; or &quot;architecture&quot; and ascribed to Mamuni Mayan,[411] explores how the laws of
nature affect human dwellings;[412] it employs precise geometry and directional alignments to reflect perceived cosmic
constructs.[413] As applied in Hindu temple architecture, it is influenced by the Shilpa Shastras, a series of foundational texts
whose basic mythological form is the Vastu-Purusha mandala, a square that embodied the &quot;absolute&quot;.[414] The Taj Mahal, built in
Agra between 1631 and 1648 by orders of Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife, has been described in the UNESCO World
Heritage List as &quot;the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world&#39;s heritage&quot;.[415]
Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture, developed by the British in the late 19th century, drew on Indo-Islamic architecture.[416]</p>
<p>LITERATURE</p>
<p>Main article: Indian literature</p>
<p>The earliest literature in India, composed between 1500 BCE and 1200 CE, was in the Sanskrit language.[417] Major works of
Sanskrit literature include the Rigveda (c. 1500 BCE – c. 1200 BCE), the epics: Mahābhārata (c. 400 BCE – c. 400 CE) and the
Ramayana (c. 300 BCE and later); Abhijñānaśākuntalam (The Recognition of Śakuntalā, and other dramas of Kālidāsa (c. 5th
century CE) and Mahākāvya poetry.[418][419][420] In Tamil literature, the Sangam literature (c. 600 BCE – c. 300 BCE) consisting
of 2,381 poems, composed by 473 poets, is the earliest work.[421][422][423][424] From the 14th to the 18th centuries, India&#39;s
literary traditions went through a period of drastic change because of the emergence of devotional poets like Kabīr, Tulsīdās, and
Guru Nānak. This period was characterised by a varied and wide spectrum of thought and expression; as a consequence, medieval
Indian literary works differed significantly from classical traditions.[425] In the 19th century, Indian writers took a new
interest in social questions and psychological descriptions. In the 20th century, Indian literature was influenced by the works of
Rabindranath Tagore,[426] who was a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature.</p>
<p>PERFORMING ARTS AND MEDIA</p>
<p>Main articles: Music of India, Dance in India, Cinema of India, and Television in India
India&#39;s National Academy of Performance Arts has recognised eight Indian dance styles to be classical. One such is Kuchipudi shown
here.</p>
<p>Indian music ranges over various traditions and regional styles. Classical music encompasses two genres and their various folk
offshoots: the northern Hindustani and the southern Carnatic schools.[427] Regionalised popular forms include filmi and folk
music; the syncretic tradition of the bauls is a well-known form of the latter. Indian dance also features diverse folk and
classical forms. Among the better-known folk dances are: bhangra of Punjab, bihu of Assam, Jhumair and chhau of Jharkhand, Odisha
and West Bengal, garba and dandiya of Gujarat, ghoomar of Rajasthan, and lavani of Maharashtra. Eight dance forms, many with
narrative forms and mythological elements, have been accorded classical dance status by India&#39;s National Academy of Music, Dance,
and Drama. These are: bharatanatyam of the state of Tamil Nadu, kathak of Uttar Pradesh, kathakali and mohiniyattam of Kerala,
kuchipudi of Andhra Pradesh, manipuri of Manipur, odissi of Odisha, and the sattriya of Assam.[428]</p>
<p>Theatre in India melds music, dance, and improvised or written dialogue.[429] Often based on Hindu mythology, but also borrowing
from medieval romances or social and political events, Indian theatre includes: the bhavai of Gujarat, the jatra of West Bengal,
the nautanki and ramlila of North India, tamasha of Maharashtra, burrakatha of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, terukkuttu of Tamil
Nadu, and the yakshagana of Karnataka.[430] India has a theatre training institute, the National School of Drama (NSD), in New
Delhi.[431] The Indian film industry produces the world&#39;s most-watched cinema.[432] Established regional cinematic traditions
exist in the Assamese, Bengali, Bhojpuri, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Punjabi, Gujarati, Marathi, Odia, Tamil, and Telugu
languages.[433] The Hindi language film industry (Bollywood) is the largest sector representing 43% of box office revenue,
followed by the South Indian Telugu and Tamil film industries which represent 36% combined.[434]</p>
<p>Television broadcasting began in India in 1959 as a state-run medium of communication and expanded slowly for more than two
decades.[435][436] The state monopoly on television broadcast ended in the 1990s. Since then, satellite channels have increasingly
shaped the popular culture of Indian society.[437] Today, television is the most penetrative media in India; industry estimates
indicate that as of 2012[update] there are over 554 million TV consumers, 462 million with satellite or cable connections compared
to other forms of mass media such as the press (350 million), radio (156 million) or internet (37 million).[438]</p>
<p>SOCIETY</p>
<p>Muslims offer namaz at a mosque in Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir.</p>
<p>Traditional Indian society is sometimes defined by social hierarchy. The Indian caste system embodies much of the social
stratification and many of the social restrictions found on the Indian subcontinent. Social classes are defined by thousands of
endogamous hereditary groups, often termed as jātis, or &quot;castes&quot;.[439] India abolished untouchability in 1950 with the adoption of
the constitution and has since enacted other anti-discriminatory laws and social welfare initiatives.</p>
<p>Family values are important in the Indian tradition, and multi-generational patrilineal joint families have been the norm in
India, though nuclear families are becoming common in urban areas.[440] An overwhelming majority of Indians, with their consent,
have their marriages arranged by their parents or other family elders.[441] Marriage is thought to be for life,[441] and the
divorce rate is extremely low,[442] with less than one in a thousand marriages ending in divorce.[443] Child marriages are common,
especially in rural areas; many women wed before reaching 18, which is their legal marriageable age.[444] Female infanticide in
India, and lately female foeticide, have created skewed gender ratios; the number of missing women in the country quadrupled from
15 million to 63 million in the 50-year period ending in 2014, faster than the population growth during the same period.[445]
According to an Indian government study, an additional 21 million girls are unwanted and do not receive adequate care.[446]
Despite a government ban on sex-selective foeticide, the practice remains commonplace in India, the result of a preference for
boys in a patriarchal society.[447] The payment of dowry, although illegal, remains widespread across class lines.[448] Deaths
resulting from dowry, mostly from bride burning, are on the rise, despite stringent anti-dowry laws.[449]</p>
<p>Many Indian festivals are religious in origin. The best known include Diwali, Ganesh Chaturthi, Thai Pongal, Holi, Durga Puja, Eid
ul-Fitr, Bakr-Id, Christmas, and Vaisakhi.[450][451]</p>

<p>In the 2011 census, about 73% of the population was literate, with 81% for men and 65% for women. This compares to 1981 when the
respective rates were 41%, 53% and 29%. In 1951 the rates were 18%, 27% and 9%. In 1921 the rates 7%, 12% and 2%. In 1891 they
were 5%, 9% and 1%,[452][453] According to Latika Chaudhary, in 1911 there were under three primary schools for every ten
villages. Statistically, more caste and religious diversity reduced private spending. Primary schools taught literacy, so local
diversity limited its growth.[454]</p>
<p>The education system of India is the world&#39;s second-largest.[455] India has over 900 universities, 40,000 colleges[456] and
1.5 million schools.[457] In India&#39;s higher education system, a significant number of seats are reserved under affirmative action
policies for the historically disadvantaged. In recent decades India&#39;s improved education system is often cited as one of the main
contributors to its economic development.[458][459]</p>
<p>CLOTHING</p>
<p>Main article: Clothing in India

A man in dhoti and wearing a woollen shawl, in Varanasi</p>
<p>From ancient times until the advent of the modern, the most widely worn traditional dress in India was draped.[460] For women it
took the form of a sari, a single piece of cloth many yards long.[460] The sari was traditionally wrapped around the lower body
and the shoulder.[460] In its modern form, it is combined with an underskirt, or Indian petticoat, and tucked in the waist band
for more secure fastening. It is also commonly worn with an Indian blouse, or choli, which serves as the primary upper-body
garment, the sari&#39;s end—passing over the shoulder—covering the midriff and obscuring the upper body&#39;s contours.[460] For men, a
similar but shorter length of cloth, the dhoti, has served as a lower-body garment.[461]</p>
<p>The use of stitched clothes became widespread after Muslim rule was established at first by the Delhi sultanate (c. 1300 CE) and
then continued by the Mughal Empire (c. 1525 CE).[462] Among the garments introduced during this time and still commonly worn are:
the shalwars and pyjamas, both styles of trousers, and the tunics kurta and kameez.[462] In southern India, the traditional draped
garments were to see much longer continuous use.[462]</p>
<p>Women (from left to right) in churidars and kameez (with back to the camera), jeans and sweater, and pink shalwar kameez</p>
<p>Salwars are atypically wide at the waist but narrow to a cuffed bottom. They are held up by a drawstring, which causes them to
become pleated around the waist.[463] The pants can be wide and baggy, or they can be cut quite narrow, on the bias, in which case
they are called churidars. When they are ordinarily wide at the waist and their bottoms are hemmed but not cuffed, they are called
pyjamas. The kameez is a long shirt or tunic,[464] its side seams left open below the waistline.[465] The kurta is traditionally
collarless and made of cotton or silk; it is worn plain or with embroidered decoration, such as chikan; and typically falls to
either just above or just below the wearer&#39;s knees.[466]</p>
<p>In the last 50 years, fashions have changed a great deal in India. Increasingly, in urban northern India, the sari is no longer
the apparel of everyday wear, though they remain popular on formal occasions.[467] The traditional shalwar kameez is rarely worn
by younger urban women, who favour churidars or jeans.[467] In office settings, ubiquitous air conditioning allows men to wear
sports jackets year-round.[467] For weddings and formal occasions, men in the middle- and upper classes often wear bandgala, or
short Nehru jackets, with pants, with the groom and his groomsmen sporting sherwanis and churidars.[467] The dhoti, once the
universal garment of Hindu males, the wearing of which in the homespun and handwoven khadi allowed Gandhi to bring Indian
nationalism to the millions,[468] is seldom seen in the cities.[467]</p>
<p>CUISINE</p>
<p>Main article: Indian cuisine
South Indian vegetarian thali, or platter
Railway mutton curry from Odisha</p>
<p>The foundation of a typical Indian meal is a cereal cooked in a plain fashion and complemented with flavourful savoury
dishes.[469] The cooked cereal could be steamed rice; chapati, a thin unleavened bread;[470] the idli, a steamed breakfast cake;
or dosa, a griddled pancake.[471] The savoury dishes might include lentils, pulses and vegetables commonly spiced with ginger and
garlic, but also with a combination of spices that may include coriander, cumin, turmeric, cinnamon, cardamon and others.[469]
They might also include poultry, fish, or meat dishes. In some instances, the ingredients might be mixed during the process of
cooking.[472]</p>
<p>A platter, or thali, used for eating usually has a central place reserved for the cooked cereal, and peripheral ones for the
flavourful accompaniments. The cereal and its accompaniments are eaten simultaneously rather than a piecemeal manner. This is
accomplished by mixing—for example of rice and lentils—or folding, wrapping, scooping or dipping—such as chapati and cooked
vegetables.[469]</p>
<p>A tandoor chef in the Turkman Gate, Old Delhi, makes Khameeri roti (a Muslim-influenced style of leavened bread).[473]</p>
<p>India has distinctive vegetarian cuisines, each a feature of the geographical and cultural histories of its adherents.[474] The
appearance of ahimsa, or the avoidance of violence toward all forms of life in many religious orders early in Indian history,
especially Upanishadic Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, is thought to have contributed to the predominance of vegetarianism among a
large segment of India&#39;s Hindu population, especially in southern India, Gujarat, the Hindi-speaking belt of north-central India,
as well as among Jains.[474] Although meat is eaten widely in India, the proportional consumption of meat in the overall diet is
low.[475] Unlike China, which has increased its per capita meat consumption substantially in its years of increased economic
growth, in India the strong dietary traditions have contributed to dairy, rather than meat, becoming the preferred form of animal
protein consumption.[476]</p>
<p>The most significant import of cooking techniques into India during the last millennium occurred during the Mughal Empire. Dishes
such as the pilaf,[477] developed in the Abbasid caliphate,[478] and cooking techniques such as the marinating of meat in yogurt,
spread into northern India from regions to its northwest.[479] To the simple yogurt marinade of Persia, onions, garlic, almonds,
and spices began to be added in India.[479] Rice was partially cooked and layered alternately with the sauteed meat, the pot
sealed tightly, and slow cooked according to another Persian cooking technique, to produce what has today become biryani,[479] a
feature of festive dining in many parts of India.[480] In the food served in Indian restaurants worldwide the diversity of Indian
food has been partially concealed by the dominance of Punjabi cuisine. The popularity of tandoori chicken—cooked in the tandoor
oven, which had traditionally been used for baking bread in the rural Punjab and the Delhi region, especially among Muslims, but
which is originally from Central Asia—dates to the 1950s, and was caused in large part by an entrepreneurial response among people
from the Punjab who had been displaced by the 1947 partition.[474]</p>

rise in the number of Indian grandmasters,[483] and world champions.[484] Parcheesi is derived from Pachisi, another traditional
Indian pastime, which in early modern times was played on a giant marble court by Mughal emperor Akbar the Great.[485]</p>
<p>Cricket is the most popular sport in India.[486] India has won two Cricket World Cups, the 1983 edition and the 2011 edition.
India has won eight field hockey gold medals in the summer Olympics.[487] India has participated in shooting sports and has won
several medals at the Olympics, the World Shooting Championships, and the Commonwealth Games.[488][489] Other sports in which
Indians have succeeded internationally include badminton,[490] boxing,[491] and wrestling.[492] Football is popular in West
Bengal, Goa, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and the north-eastern states. The major domestic league is the Indian Premier League.
Professional leagues in other sports include the Indian Super League (football) and the Pro Kabaddi League.[493][494][495]</p>

authorise as occasion arises; and the song Vande Mataram, which has played a historic part in the struggle for Indian
freedom, shall be honoured equally with Jana Gana Mana and shall have equal status with it.&quot;[5]</p>

India. However, this is disputed, and the region bordering Afghanistan is administered by Pakistan.[27]</p>

<li><p>^ &quot;A Chinese pilgrim also recorded evidence of the caste system as he could observe it. According to this evidence the
treatment meted out to untouchables such as the Chandalas was very similar to that which they experienced in later periods.
This would contradict assertions that this rigid form of the caste system emerged in India only as a reaction to the Islamic
conquest.&quot;[42]</p>

<li><p>^ &quot;Shah Jahan eventually sent her body 800 km (500 mi) to Agra for burial in the Rauza-i Munauwara (&quot;Illuminated Tomb&quot;) – a
personal tribute and a stone manifestation of his imperial power. This tomb has been celebrated globally as the Taj
Mahal.&quot;[50]</p>

<li><p>^ The northernmost point under Indian control is the disputed Siachen Glacier in Jammu and Kashmir; however, the Government
of India regards the entire region of the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir, including the Gilgit-Baltistan
administered by Pakistan, to be its territory. It therefore assigns the latitude 37° 6′ to its northernmost point.</p>

creation of representative institutions and expanding electorate under British rule than by the endeavours of India&#39;s
founding fathers – Gandhi, Nehru, Patel and Ambedkar – and the labours of the Constituent Assembly between 1946 and 1949,
embodied in the Indian constitution of 1950. This democratic order, reinforced by the regular holding of nationwide
elections and polling for the state assemblies, has, it can be argued, consistently underpinned a fundamentally democratic
state structure – despite the anomaly of the Emergency and the apparent durability of the Gandhi-Nehru dynasty.</p>

60,000 and 80,000 years ago, tiny groups of them began to enter the north-west of the Indian subcontinent. It seems likely
that initially they came by way of the coast. ... it is virtually certain that there were Homo sapiens in the subcontinent

have been prior unsuccessful emigrations. Some of their descendants extended the human range ever further in each
generation, spreading into each habitable land they encountered. One human channel was along the warm and productive coastal
lands of the Persian Gulf and northern Indian Ocean. Eventually, various bands entered India between 75,000 years ago and
35,000 years ago.&quot;</p>

recital during rituals and for the invocation of and communication with the Indo-Aryan gods. Modern scholarly opinion
largely agrees that these hymns were composed between around 1500 BCE and 1200 BCE, during the eastward migration of the
Indo-Aryan tribes from the mountains of what is today northern Afghanistan across the Punjab into north India.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p>^ (a) Witzel 2003, pp. 68–70, &quot;It is known from internal evidence that the Vedic texts were orally composed in northern
India, at first in the Greater Punjab and later on also in more eastern areas, including northern Bihar, between ca. 1500
BCE and ca. 500–400 BCE. The oldest text, the Rgveda, must have been more or less contemporary with the Mitanni texts of
northern Syria/Iraq (1450–1350 BCE); [...] The Vedic texts were orally composed and transmitted, without the use of script,
in an unbroken line of transmission from teacher to student that was formalised early on. This ensured an impeccable textual
transmission superior to the classical texts of other cultures; it is in fact something of a tape-recording of ca. 1500–500
BCE. Not just the actual words, but even the long-lost musical (tonal) accent (as in old Greek or in Japanese) has been
preserved up to the present. [...] The RV text was composed before the introduction and massive use of iron, that is before
ca. 1200–1000 BCE.&quot;;

Veda and Atharva Veda [...] Hindu texts began with the Rig Veda (&#39;Knowledge of Verses&#39;), composed in northwest India around
1500 BCE; the first of the three Vedas, it is the earliest extant text composed in Sanskrit, the language of ancient
India.&quot;;
(c) Ludden 2014, p. 19, &quot;In Punjab, a dry region with grasslands watered by five rivers (hence &#39;panch&#39; and &#39;ab&#39;) draining
the western Himalayas, one prehistoric culture left no material remains, but some of its ritual texts were preserved orally
over the millennia. The culture is called Aryan, and evidence in its texts indicates that it spread slowly south-east,
following the course of the Yamuna and Ganga Rivers. Its elite called itself Arya (pure) and distinguished themselves
sharply from others. Aryans led kin groups organized as nomadic horse-herding tribes. Their ritual texts are called Vedas,
composed in Sanskrit. Vedic Sanskrit is recorded only in hymns that were part of Vedic rituals to Aryan gods. To be Aryan
apparently meant to belong to the elite among pastoral tribes. Texts that record Aryan culture are not precisely datable,
but they seem to begin around 1200 BCE with four collections of Vedic hymns (Rg, Sama, Yajur, and Artharva).&quot;;
(d) Dyson 2018, pp. 14–15, &quot;Although the collapse of the Indus valley civilization is no longer believed to have been due to
an &#39;Aryan invasion&#39; it is widely thought that, at roughly the same time, or perhaps a few centuries later, new
Indo-Aryan-speaking people and influences began to enter the subcontinent from the north-west. Detailed evidence is lacking.
Nevertheless, a predecessor of the language that would eventually be called Sanskrit was probably introduced into the
north-west sometime between 3,900 and 3,000 years ago. This language was related to one then spoken in eastern Iran; and
both of these languages belonged to the Indo-European language family. [...] It seems likely that various small-scale
migrations were involved in the gradual introduction of the predecessor language and associated cultural characteristics.
However, there may not have been a tight relationship between movements of people on the one hand, and changes in language
and culture on the other. Moreover, the process whereby a dynamic new force gradually arose—a people with a distinct
ideology who eventually seem to have referred to themselves as &#39;Arya&#39;—was certainly two-way. That is, it involved a blending
of new features which came from outside with other features—probably including some surviving Harappan influences—that were
already present. Anyhow, it would be quite a few centuries before Sanskrit was written down. And the hymns and stories of
the Arya people—especially the Vedas and the later Mahabharata and Ramayana epics—are poor guides as to historical events.
Of course, the emerging Arya were to have a huge impact on the history of the subcontinent. Nevertheless, little is known
about their early presence.&quot;;
(e) Robb 2011, pp. 46–, &quot;The expansion of Aryan culture is supposed to have begun around 1500 BCE. It should not be thought
that this Aryan emergence (though it implies some migration) necessarily meant either a sudden invasion of new peoples, or a
complete break with earlier traditions. It comprises a set of cultural ideas and practices, upheld by a Sanskrit-speaking
elite, or Aryans. The features of this society are recorded in the Vedas.&quot;</p>

RgVeda is one of the four Vedas, which together constitute the oldest texts in Sanskrit and the earliest evidence for what

Hinduism, the seeds are there. Gods like Visnu and Siva (under the name Rudra), who will become so dominant later, are
already present in the Rgveda, though in roles both lesser than and different from those they will later play, and the
principal Rgvedic gods like Indra remain in later Hinduism, though in diminished capacity (p. 4).;

origins, belonging to endogamous social units (jati/varna), participating in practices that involve making an offering to a

monotheism in which many gods are regarded as emanations or manifestations of the one, supreme being).;

observe until today at least three samskaras (initiation, marriage, and death ritual). Most other rituals have lost their
popularity, are combined with other rites of passage, or are drastically shortened. Although samskaras vary from region to
region, from class (varna) to class, and from caste to caste, their core elements remain the same owing to the common
source, the Veda, and a common priestly tradition preserved by the Brahmin priests. (p 86)

resource and inspiration for Hindu traditions and individuals. The Veda is the foundation for most later developments in

one-third of the subcontinent and a quarter of its population, became legally independent, their status to be settled later.
Geographical location, personal and popular sentiment, and substantial pressure and incentives from the new governments led
almost all princes eventually to merge their domains into either Pakistan or India. ... Each new government asserted its
exclusive sovereignty within its borders, realigning all territories, animals, plants, minerals, and all other natural and
human-made resources as either Pakistani or Indian property, to be used for its national development... Simultaneously, the
central civil and military services and judiciary split roughly along religious &#39;communal&#39; lines, even as they divided
movable government assets according to a negotiated formula: 22.7 percent for Pakistan and 77.3 percent for India.&quot;</p>

Chatterji describes how the partition of the British Indian empire into the new nation states of India and Pakistan produced
new diaspora on a vast, and hitherto unprecedented, scale, but hints that the sheer magnitude of refugee movements in South
Asia after 1947 must be understood in the context of pre-existing migratory flows within the partitioned regions (see also
Chatterji 2013). She also demonstrates that the new national states of India and Pakistan were quickly drawn into trying to
stem this migration. As they put into place laws designed to restrict the return of partition emigrants, this produced new
dilemmas for both new nations in their treatment of &#39;overseas Indians&#39;; and many of them lost their right to return to their
places of origin in the subcontinent, and also their claims to full citizenship in host countries.</p>

they not only partitioned the subcontinent with the emergence of the two nations of India and Pakistan but also the
provinces of Punjab and Bengal. ... Indeed for many the Indian subcontinent&#39;s division in August 1947 is seen as a unique
event which defies comparative historical and conceptual analysis</p>

University Press, p. 1, ISBN 978-0-300-23032-1, South Asians learned that the British Indian empire would be partitioned on
3 June 1947. They heard about it on the radio, from relations and friends, by reading newspapers and, later, through
government pamphlets. Among a population of almost four hundred million, where the vast majority live in the countryside,
ploughing the land as landless peasants or sharecroppers, it is hardly surprising that many thousands, perhaps hundreds of
thousands, did not hear the news for many weeks afterwards. For some, the butchery and forced relocation of the summer
months of 1947 may have been the first that they knew about the creation of the two new states rising from the fragmentary
and terminally weakened British empire in India</p>

lived beyond the Indus River. The term Hindu originated as a geographical term and did not refer to a religion. Later, Hindu
was taken by European languages from the Arabic term al-Hind, which referred to the people who lived across the Indus River.
This Arabic term was itself taken from the Persian term Hindū, which refers to all Indians. By the 13th century, Hindustan
emerged as a popular alternative name for India, meaning the &quot;land of Hindus.&quot;</p>

interspersed by rolling grasslands which were grazed on by millions of Blackbuck, accompanied by their dominant predator,
the Cheetah. Always keen hunters, the Moghul princes kept tame cheetahs which were used to chase and bring down the
Blackbuck. Today the Cheetah is extinct in India and the severely endangered Blackbuck no longer exists in the Punjab.</p>

The ensuing cycle of escalation culminated in the 1962 Sino-Indian border war in which Mao Zedong&#39;s troops overran almost
the entire state of Arunachal Pradesh in the eastern sector before unilaterally withdrawing, as if to underline the insult;
most of the war&#39;s several thousand casualties were Indian. The PLA&#39;s decisive victories in the 1962 war not only humiliated
the Indian Army, they also entrenched a status quo in Ladakh that was highly unfavourable for India, in which China controls
almost all of the disputed territory. A nationalistic press and commentariat have kept 1962 vivid in India&#39;s popular
consciousness.

ISBN 978-0-19-909163-8, Lin Biao was put in charge of the operation and that alliance between Mao and his loyal de facto
chief of the PLA made the attack on India possible. With China&#39;s ultimate victory in the war, Mao&#39;s ultra-leftist line had
won in China; whatever critical voices that were left in the Party after all the purges fell silent.

Press, ISBN 978-1-5261-5077-6, From an Indian perspective, the China-India war of 1962 was a shocking betrayal of the
principles of co-operation and coexistence: a surprise attack that humiliated India and personally broke Nehru.
(e) Ganguly, Sumit (1997), The Crisis in Kashmir: Portents of War, Hope of Peace, Woodrow Wilson Center Press and Cambridge
University Press, p. 44, ISBN 978-0-521-65566-8, In October 1962 India suffered the most humiliating military debacle in its
post-independence history, at the hands of the Chinese People&#39;s Liberation Army (PLA). The outcome of this conflict had
far-reaching consequences for Indian foreign and defence policies. The harsh defeat that the Chinese PLA had inflicted on
the Indian Army called into question some of the most deeply held precepts of Nehru&#39;s foreign and defence policies.

to prevent the Chinese from occupying territory claimed by them was undertaken in the mistaken belief that Beijing would be
cautious in dealing with India owing to Moscow&#39;s stance on the dispute and its growing proximity to India. These
misjudgments would eventually culminate in India&#39;s humiliating defeat in the war of October–November 1962.</p>

last 50 years of Indian democracy, the absolute number of missing women has increased fourfold from 15 million to 68
million. This is not merely a reflection of the growth in the overall population, but, rather, of the fact that this
dangerous trend has worsened with time. As a percentage of the female electorate, missing women have gone up significantly —
from 13 per cent to approximately 20 per cent</p>

Retrieved 17 November 2019. Quote: &quot;More than 63 million women are &quot;missing&quot; statistically across India, and more than 21
million girls are unwanted by their families, government officials say. The skewed ratio of men to women is largely the
result of sex-selective abortions, and better nutrition and medical care for boys, according to the government&#39;s annual
economic survey, which was released on Monday. In addition, the survey found that &quot;families where a son is born are more
likely to stop having children than families where a girl is born&quot;.</p>

Idli cakes are soft, moist and spongy, have desirable sour flavour, and is eaten as breakfast in South India. Dosa batter is

traditions of dress, &#39;architecture and cuisine&#39; were adopted by non-Muslim indigenous elites in South Asia. In this manner,
Central Asian cooking merged with older traditions within the subcontinent, to create such signature dishes as biryani (a
fusion of the Persian pilau and the spice-laden dishes of Hindustan), and the Kashmiri meat stew of Rogan Josh. It not only
generated new dishes and entire cuisines, but also fostered novel modes of eating. Such newer trends included the
consumption of Persian condiments, which relied heavily on almonds, pastries and quince jams, alongside Indian achars made
from sweet limes, green vegetables and curds as side relishes during Mughlai meals.</p>
